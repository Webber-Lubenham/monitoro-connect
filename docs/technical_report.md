# Technical Report: Authentication and Integration Issues Resolution

## Project: Student Sentinel Hub
**Date:** February 23, 2025  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Executive Summary
This document outlines critical issues encountered in the Student Sentinel Hub system regarding authentication, local storage management, and third-party service integrations. All identified issues have been successfully resolved through systematic implementation of solutions.

## 2. Issue Analysis

### 2.1 Row Level Security (RLS) Issues
- **Problem:** Infinite recursion in access policies
- **Affected Tables:**
  - profiles
  - guardians
  - parent_notification_preferences
- **Resolution:** Implemented optimized RLS policies with proper access rules

### 2.2 Mapbox Integration Issues
- **Problem:** Authentication errors with Mapbox service
- **Resolution:**
  - Dedicated Mapbox configuration file created
  - Implemented `getMapboxToken()` for consistent token access
  - Centralized token management

### 2.3 Local Storage and Authentication
- **Problem:** Inconsistent session management
- **Resolution:**
```javascript
// Supabase Client Configuration
{
  auth: {
    persistSession: true,
    autoRefreshToken: true,
    storage: localStorage,
    storageKey: 'supabase.auth.token'
  }
}

// Session Management
supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((event, session) => {
  if (event === 'SIGNED_OUT') {
    localStorage.removeItem('supabase.auth.token');
  }
});
```

### 2.4 API Request Errors
- **Problem:** 500 errors on table requests
- **Resolution:** Updated RLS policies to ensure:
  - Proper guardian data access
  - Notification preference access
  - User permission validation

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Authentication Flow
- Explicit localStorage configuration
- Session persistence management
- Proper token cleanup on logout

### 3.2 Mapbox Integration
- Centralized token configuration
- Dedicated access function
- Error handling improvements

## 4. Benefits

### Security Improvements
- Enhanced token management
- Proper session cleanup
- Structured access control

### User Experience
- Stable user sessions
- Reliable authentication
- Consistent map functionality

### Maintainability
- Centralized configurations
- Clear authentication flow
- Documented access policies

## 5. Future Recommendations

### Monitoring
- Implement detailed logging
- Track authentication failures
- Monitor API response times

### Security
- Regular RLS policy reviews
- Automated token refresh
- Security audit implementation

### Performance
- localStorage impact assessment
- Caching strategy evaluation
- API request optimization

## 6. Conclusion
The implemented solutions have successfully addressed the core issues affecting the system's authentication and integration capabilities. Continuous monitoring is recommended to ensure sustained effectiveness of these solutions.
