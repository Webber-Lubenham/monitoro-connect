# Student Sentinel Hub - Project Diagnostic Report

## 1. Application Overview
**Core Objective:**  
Real-time student location tracking system that sends email notifications to parents/guardians via Resend API when students arrive at or depart from designated locations.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time GPS location tracking
- Geofencing capabilities
- Automated email notifications
- Parent/guardian dashboard
- Student safety monitoring

## 2. Current Implementation Status

### Successes Achieved
‚úÖ **Completed Features:**
- Functional location tracking backend (Supabase)
- Resend email integration working
- Basic geofencing implementation
- Parent dashboard showing live location
- Secure authentication system

### Current Challenges
‚ö†Ô∏è **Technical Issues:**
1. **Email Delivery Reliability**
   - Occasional delays in Resend notifications
   - Some emails marked as spam

2. **Location Accuracy**
   - GPS drift in urban areas
   - Battery optimization affecting tracking

3. **Database Performance**
   - Scaling issues with high user loads
   - Migration conflicts in Supabase

4. **UI/UX Challenges**
   - Complex parent dashboard navigation
   - Lack of notification customization

## 3. Pending Implementations

### High Priority Items
üîß **Immediate Needs:**
- [ ] Notification preferences system
