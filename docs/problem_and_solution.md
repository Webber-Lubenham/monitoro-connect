# Problem and Solution Document

## Problem Description
The application is encountering errors when trying to access the `user_id` column in the `parent_notification_preferences` table. Fetch requests are returning a 400 Bad Request status due to the absence of this column.

## Impact
Users may not be able to retrieve or interact with notification preferences, leading to a degraded user experience.

## Solution
1. Verify the schema of the `parent_notification_preferences` table to check if the `user_id` column exists.
2. If the column is missing, consider adding it to the table.
3. Update any relevant queries or application logic to ensure compatibility with the updated schema.

## Next Steps
- Review the database schema.
- Implement the necessary changes based on the findings.
