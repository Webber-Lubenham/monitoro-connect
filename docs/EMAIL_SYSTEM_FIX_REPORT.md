# Email System Fix Report

**Date:** March 16, 2025  
**Author:** Development Team

## Overview of Fixes

We have implemented multiple fixes to address the email delivery system issues reported in our technical documentation:

### 1. Edge Function Client Payload Format

**Problem:** The Edge Function client was sending incorrectly formatted payloads to the `send-email` function, resulting in 400 Bad Request errors.

**Fix:** We restructured the payload format in `edgeFunctionClient.ts` to match what the Edge Function expects:

```javascript
// Before - Incorrect nested format:
const payload = {
  payload: {  // This nesting was causing the issue
    from,
    to,
    subject,
    html,
    text
  }
};

// After - Correct direct format:
const payload = {
  from,
  to,
  subject,
  html,
  text
};
```

This change aligns with how the `send-email` Edge Function is configured to parse the incoming request body.

### 2. Email Diagnostic Tools

To help debug future issues, we've enhanced the email testing capabilities:

- Added detailed logging of request/response data
- Created a dedicated `/email-tester` page with comprehensive testing tools
- Implemented specific Edge Function connectivity tests

### 3. Additional Improvements

- Added error handling for rate limiting scenarios
- Improved fallback mechanisms when Edge Functions fail
- Enhanced logging throughout the email delivery process

## Verification Steps

To verify these fixes:

1. Navigate to the `/email-tester` page
2. Use the "Test Edge Function" button to verify basic connectivity
3. Use the "Test Email Function" to test email delivery
4. Check the console logs for detailed diagnostics

## Next Steps

While these changes should resolve the immediate email delivery issues, we recommend:

1. Implementing a proper email queue system for retry logic
2. Setting up monitoring for Edge Function errors
3. Regularly testing the email delivery system
