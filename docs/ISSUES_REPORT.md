# Technical Issues Report - Sistema Monitore

**Date:** March 16, 2025  
**Author:** Development Team  
**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This document identifies and analyzes the technical issues currently affecting the Sistema Monitore application. The main problematic areas are:

1. Email notification system failures
2. Geolocation accuracy and timeout issues
3. Edge Function communication errors
4. User interface performance concerns

## Critical Issues

### 1. Email Notification System Failure

**Severity:** High  
**Status:** Active

The system is consistently failing to send location notifications to guardians due to issues with the Supabase Edge Function integration. This severely impacts the core functionality of the application, as it prevents guardians from receiving critical location updates.

**Error Logs:**
```
POST https://usnrnaxpoqmojxsfcoox.supabase.co/functions/v1/send-email 400 (Bad Request)
[EMAIL] ERROR: Erro na Edge Function send-email: FunctionsHttpError: Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Payload format mismatch between client request and Edge Function expectations
- The error consistently occurs with HTTP 400 status code
- Multiple retries fail with the same error pattern

**Impact:**
- Guardians do not receive notifications when students share their location
- Critical alerts for emergency situations may not be delivered
- Core value proposition of the application is compromised

### 2. Geolocation Reliability Issues

**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** Active

The application experiences frequent timeouts when trying to obtain precise user location, leading to a degraded user experience. The system falls back to approximate locations with very low accuracy.

**Error Logs:**
```
Error getting initial position: GeolocationPositionError {code: 3, message: 'Timeout expired'}
Fallback location obtained: {latitude: 52.4228, longitude: -0.8926, accuracy: 1000, altitude: null, speed: null, â€¦}
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Geolocation API timeout occurs after 15 seconds
- Network connectivity issues may contribute to the problem
- Mobile browser permission and background tracking limitations

**Impact:**
- Location tracking is unreliable or highly inaccurate
- Map visualization shows incorrect user positions
- Guardians may receive inaccurate location data

### 3. Performance Issues

**Severity:** Low  
**Status:** Active

The application shows warning signs of performance issues, particularly with event handlers and animation frames taking too long to execute.

**Warning Logs:**
```
[Violation] 'requestAnimationFrame' handler took 62ms
[Violation] Added non-passive event listener to a scroll-blocking 'touchmove' event
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Non-passive event listeners affecting scroll performance
- Long-running operations in animation frame callbacks
- Inefficient rendering cycles in map components

**Impact:**
- Degraded user experience, especially on mobile devices
- Potential application lag or unresponsiveness
- Battery drain on mobile devices

## Action Items

### Short-term Fixes (24-48 hours)

1. **Email Notification System**
   - Debug the Edge Function locally to identify payload format issues
   - Implement proper error handling and detailed logging
   - Add fallback notification mechanisms for critical alerts

2. **Geolocation Improvements**
   - Increase timeout values for geolocation API
   - Enhance fallback mechanisms with more accurate IP-based geolocation
   - Improve user feedback during location acquisition

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Convert touch event listeners to passive
   - Optimize animation frame handlers
   - Reduce unnecessary re-renders in React components

### Medium-term Improvements (1-2 weeks)

1. **Notification Infrastructure**
   - Redesign notification flow with queue system for retry logic
   - Implement multiple delivery channels (email, push, in-app)
   - Create comprehensive monitoring for notification delivery

2. **Geolocation Strategy**
   - Implement advanced location tracking with better battery efficiency
   - Add user controls for location precision preferences
   - Develop a hybrid approach combining GPS, network, and IP-based locations

3. **Application Architecture**
   - Refactor critical components for better performance
   - Implement comprehensive error boundary system
   - Enhance logging and monitoring infrastructure

## Conclusion

The identified issues significantly impact core functionality of the Sistema Monitore application. The email notification problem is the most critical issue that requires immediate attention, followed by geolocation reliability improvements. 

Our team will prioritize fixing the email notification system within the next 24 hours, followed by the geolocation enhancements. Performance optimizations will be addressed as part of the medium-term improvements.
