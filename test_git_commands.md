# Test Git Commands

This document outlines the steps to test basic Git commands: `add`, `commit`, `push`, and `status`.

## Steps to Test Git Commands

1. **Check Git Status**
   - Before making any changes, check the current status of the repository.
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **Make Changes**
   - Create or modify a file in the repository. For example, create a new file named `test_file.txt`.
   ```bash
   echo "This is a test file." > test_file.txt
   ```

3. **Add Changes**
   - Stage the changes for commit.
   ```bash
   git add test_file.txt
   ```

4. **Check Git Status Again**
   - Verify that the changes have been staged.
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

5. **Commit Changes**
   - Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message.
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add test_file.txt for testing Git commands"
   ```

6. **Check Git Status Again**
   - Verify that there are no changes to commit.
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

7. **Push Changes**
   - Push the committed changes to the remote repository.
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

8. **Check Git Status Again**
   - Verify that the local branch is up to date with the remote branch.
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

## Notes
- Ensure that you have the correct permissions to push changes to the remote repository.
- If you encounter any errors during the push, check your remote repository settings and authentication.
